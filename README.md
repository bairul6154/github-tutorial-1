## Git vs. GitHub

Git is a version control system that runs in the command line which means that it keeps track of different verions of your code and save the changes you make to your files. However, Github is where you make repositories which is where you save your code forever, so if something happened to your git workspace for some reason, your code and files are always saved on Github. Git doesn't require Github to work, but Github requires Git.
